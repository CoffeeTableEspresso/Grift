* Introduction to the Gradually Typed Lambda Calculus
** Dynamic Type
** Consistency Relationship
** The Type Latices join versus meet
* Notion of Static Type Checking
** Points in the design space
*** If branches join versus meet
*** literals typed at dynamic or specific
* Notion of Dynamic Type Checking
* The Schml Compiler
** Messure the inherint efficiency of various dynamic semantics
** Give a feasible implementation technique for various dynamic semantics
** Look for optimizations that are not apparent
*** Static type equality can be reduced to pointer equality even for stuctural types
*** Type Strucures
