- [ ] Add no-optimize annotations for testing purposes
- [ ] Make sure that data structure function rep works space inefficent coercions
- [ ] Add Dynamic-Operation optimization (App-Dyn, Dyn-Gbox-ref, ...)
- [ ] Manually specialize the code for the fast cases of make coercion
      in compose.
- [ ] Add Hoist coercion constants
- [ ] Lower the letrec purification pass or raise unguarded boxes
- [ ] Simplify parser (make it untyped) and use macros (this could be done)
- [ ] Fix letrec
- [ ] add define, include
- [ ] add constant propagation, common subexpression elimination,
      and dead code elimination pass after specify
- [ ] normalize context to before specify representation
- [ ] add inlining, constant propagation, common subexpression elimination
      dead code elimination pass.
- [ ] Tail coercions optimization.
- [ ] Custom backend that allows us to play with the return register
